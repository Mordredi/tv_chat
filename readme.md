#TV Chat

This is a site where users can add shows. When a user has watched a show they are able to enter a chat room and discuss with other users.

My first attempt at a Node app.

Built using Node, Express, Socket.io, Bootstrap, Sass, and Gulp.

The site is live at: https://whispering-badlands-3674.herokuapp.com/
